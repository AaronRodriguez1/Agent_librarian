## Project Motivation and Overview ##

I designed this agent to solve a real problem I face as a master's student. With a vast number of lecture videos, manually scrubbing through each one to find specific information is time consuming. This agent automates the process by transcribing any video and creating a pipeline for semantic search. This makes it much easier to locate the exact segments I need.

Additionally, to simulate a given data base, I built a knowledge base from a collection of research papers covering various topics, each with a summary. This allows the application to not only search within videos but also to provide relevant learning resources based on the topics queried. Almost like a librarian who helps you find the right materials.
